# Pi-Motion-Sound-Detector

Simple code that uses either a sound detector or motion detector to send an email when there is activity detected.

Some setup is needed. Obviously some hardware is required including a Raspberry pi and one of the sensors. You will also need to set up SSMTP for the code to work.
